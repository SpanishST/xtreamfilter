## Quick Start

### Using Docker Hub (Recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name xtreamfilter \
  -p 8080:5000 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  spanishst/xtreamfilter:latest
```

Or with docker-compose, create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  xtreamfilter:
    image: spanishst/xtreamfilter:latest
    container_name: xtreamfilter
    ports:
      - "8080:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spanishst/xtreamfilter.git
cd xtreamfilter
```

2. **Build and run:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Next Steps

1. **Open the web UI:**

```
http://localhost:8080
```

2. **Add your Xtream source(s)** in the Sources section:
   - Name, Host, Username, Password
   - **Dedicated Route** (required): URL path for this source (e.g., `myprovider`)

3. **Configure your filters** for each source - Live TV, VOD, and Series

4. **Connect your IPTV player** using one of the connection URLs shown in the UI

## Connection URLs

XtreamFilter provides multiple ways to connect your IPTV player:

### Merged Endpoint (Recommended for Multi-Source)

Combines all sources into a single playlist with virtual IDs that prevent conflicts:

```
Server: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/merged
Username: proxy
Password: proxy
```

- All sources appear in one unified playlist
- Virtual IDs ensure no conflicts between sources (each source gets a 10M ID range)
- Filters from each source are applied

### Per-Source Endpoints

Each source has its own dedicated endpoint:

**Filtered endpoint (with your filter rules applied):**
```
Server: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/<route>
Username: (from your provider)
Password: (from your provider)
```

**Unfiltered endpoint (full catalog from this source):**
```
Server: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/<route>/full
Username: (from your provider)
Password: (from your provider)
```

### M3U Playlists

Generate M3U playlists for players that don't support Xtream API:

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/playlist.m3u` | All sources combined (merged with virtual IDs) |
| `/<route>/playlist.m3u` | Single source filtered |
| `/<route>/full/playlist.m3u` | Single source unfiltered |

## Stream Proxy Mode

When enabled, all streams are proxied through the XtreamFilter server instead of redirecting clients directly to upstream servers.

### Benefits

- **Privacy**: Upstream server URLs are hidden from clients
- **4K Performance**: Adaptive buffering optimized for 4K streams (up to 25 Mbps)
- **Freeze Prevention**: Smart pre-buffering and dynamic buffer sizing
- **Single Point of Control**: All traffic flows through your server

### Adaptive Buffering System

The proxy includes an intelligent buffering system designed to prevent freezes when upstream servers have issues:

| Feature | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Pre-buffer** | 4 MB | Initial buffer filled before streaming starts (~1.3s at 25 Mbps) |
| **Min buffer** | 1 MB | Minimum adaptive buffer size |
| **Max buffer** | 16 MB | Maximum buffer (~5s runway at 25 Mbps for 4K) |
| **Chunk size** | 512 KB | Read chunk size for efficient memory usage |

**How it works:**

1. **Pre-buffering**: Before sending any data to the client, the proxy fills a 4 MB buffer to ensure smooth playback start
2. **Throughput monitoring**: Measures upstream speed every 2 seconds, keeping 10 samples for stability
3. **Slowdown detection**: If current throughput drops below 60% of average:
   - Buffer doubles (e.g., 1 MB → 2 MB)
   - On consecutive slowdowns, buffer increases 4x for faster response
4. **Stable recovery**: After 4 stable periods (~20s), buffer reduces by 25% to optimize memory
5. **Logging**: All buffer adjustments are logged at INFO level for monitoring

**Example log output:**
```
Pre-buffer filled: 4096.0KB in 0.34s (11993.5 KB/s)
Upstream slowdown detected (2285 KB/s < 11950 KB/s avg), increasing buffer: 1024KB -> 2048KB
Upstream slowdown detected (1781 KB/s < 7832 KB/s avg), increasing buffer: 2048KB -> 8192KB
Upstream stable (2033 KB/s), reducing buffer: 16384KB -> 12288KB
```

### Toggle

Enable/disable via the web UI in the **Connection URLs** card, or via API:

```bash
# Enable proxy
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/proxy/enable

# Disable proxy  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/proxy/disable

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/proxy/status
```

When **disabled**, clients receive a 302 redirect to the upstream URL.

## Multi-Source Support

### Adding Sources

1. Open the web UI and go to the **Sources** section
2. Click **Add Source** to add a new provider
3. Enter the source details:
   - **Name**: Friendly name for the source (e.g., "Provider A")
   - **Host**: The Xtream server URL (e.g., `http://provider.example.com`)
   - **Username/Password**: Your credentials for this provider
   - **Prefix** (optional): Text to prepend to group names (e.g., `[ProvA] `)
   - **Dedicated Route** (required): URL path for this source (e.g., `providera`)
   - **Enabled**: Toggle to enable/disable this source

### Dedicated Source Routes

Each source **must have** a dedicated route. This ensures:
- No ID conflicts between providers (two sources may have series with the same ID)
- Clean separation of content per source
- Correct playback for all content types

**Example with two sources:**
- Source "Smarters" with route `smarters`:
  - Filtered: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/smarters`
  - Unfiltered: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/smarters/full`
- Source "Strong" with route `strong`:
  - Filtered: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/strong`
  - Unfiltered: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/strong/full`

### Source Prefixing

The **Prefix** option prepends text to all group names from a source, helping identify content origin when viewing in your player.

**Example:**
- Source with prefix `[US] ` → Groups become `[US] Sports`, `[US] Movies`, etc.

### Per-Source Filtering

Each source has its own independent filter configuration:
- Filters are applied per-source
- You can have different include/exclude rules per provider
- Select a source in the filter dropdown to edit its specific filters

## Filter System

### Content Categories
- **Live TV** - Television channels
- **VOD** - Movies/Films
- **Series** - TV series

### Filter Types
- **Include** - Only keep matching items (whitelist mode)
- **Exclude** - Remove matching items (blacklist mode)

### Match Modes
| Mode | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `starts_with` | Matches if name starts with value | `FR\|` matches "FR\| TF1" but NOT "ABC FR\| News" |
| `ends_with` | Matches if name ends with value | `HD` matches "Canal+ HD" |
| `contains` | Matches if name contains value anywhere | `Sports` matches "beIN Sports 1" |
| `not_contains` | Matches if name does NOT contain value | `XXX` excludes adult content |
| `exact` | Exact match only (case insensitive by default) | `TF1` matches only "TF1" |
| `regex` | Regular expression pattern | `^FR\|.*` for regex patterns |
| `all` | Matches everything | Use with "Exclude All" to start fresh |

### Exclude All Feature

The **Exclude All** option lets you start with a clean slate by excluding everything, then adding include rules to whitelist specific content:

1. Click "Exclude All Groups" or "Exclude All Channels"
2. Add "Include" filters for the specific content you want to keep

This is useful when you only want a small subset of content from a large catalog.

### Filter Examples

**Include only French content (Live TV):**
- Type: `include`, Match: `starts_with`, Value: `FR|`

**Exclude adult content (all categories):**
- Type: `exclude`, Match: `contains`, Value: `XXX`

**Include specific streaming services:**
- Type: `include`, Match: `exact`, Value: `NETFLIX SERIES`
- Type: `include`, Match: `exact`, Value: `DISNEY+ MOVIES`

**Start fresh and whitelist:**
1. Add: Type: `exclude`, Match: `all`, Value: `*`
2. Add: Type: `include`, Match: `starts_with`, Value: `FR|`

## Cache System

The proxy caches all data from upstream servers for fast responses:

- **Default TTL:** 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **Background Refresh:** Automatic refresh before cache expires
- **Real-time Progress:** Visual progress bar with step-by-step updates
- **Cross-Worker Sync:** Progress is visible even when page is reloaded
- **Disk Persistence:** Cache survives container restarts
- **Per-Source Caching:** Each source is cached independently
- **Cancel Button:** Abort stuck refreshes if needed

### Cache Status

The web UI shows:
- Total Live Streams, Movies, and Series counts
- Cache validity status (✅ valid, ⚠️ expired, 🔄 refreshing)
- Last refresh time
- Progress bar during refresh with current step and source

## Browse Content

The **Browse** feature provides a rich interface to explore all your IPTV content:

- **Visual Grid View** - Browse movies and series with cover art thumbnails
- **Search & Filter** - Search by name, filter by group/category
- **Content Details** - View descriptions, ratings, cast, and episode lists
- **Quick Actions** - Add items to custom categories directly from the browser
- **Pagination** - Efficiently browse large catalogs

Access the browser at `/browse` or click the **🔍 Browse Content** button on the main page.

## Custom Categories

Create your own categories to organize content across all sources:

### Manual Categories

Manually curate collections by adding items one by one:

1. Create a category with mode **Manual**
2. Browse content and click the ➕ button to add items
3. Items remain in the category until you remove them

### Automatic Categories

Automatically collect content based on search patterns:

1. Create a category with mode **Automatic**
2. Define search patterns (contains, starts with, regex, etc.)
3. Choose pattern logic: **Match ANY** (OR) or **Match ALL** (AND)
4. Optionally filter by **Recently Added** (last 7, 14, 30 days, etc.)
5. Enable **Apply source filter rules** to respect your source filters

**Pattern Match Types:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `contains` | Name contains value | `Marvel` matches "Marvel Avengers" |
| `starts_with` | Name starts with value | `Star Wars` matches "Star Wars: Episode IV" |
| `ends_with` | Name ends with value | `4K` matches "Avatar 4K" |
| `exact` | Exact match | `Inception` matches only "Inception" |
| `regex` | Regular expression | `^The.*\(2024\)$` for regex patterns |
| `not_contains` | Name does NOT contain | `XXX` excludes adult content |

**Example:** Create a "New 4K Movies" category:
- Mode: Automatic
- Content Types: VOD only
- Pattern: `contains` → `4K`
- Recently Added: Last 7 days
- Notify Telegram: ✅

Automatic categories refresh when the cache refreshes, detecting new content automatically.

## Architecture

XtreamFilter is built on a modern async Python stack for maximum performance:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Web Framework** | FastAPI 0.115+ | High-performance async API framework |
| **ASGI Server** | Uvicorn | Lightning-fast async server |
| **HTTP Client** | httpx | Async HTTP with connection pooling |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.13+ | Latest Python with performance improvements |

## Performance Tuning

For 4K streams and large catalogs, the application is optimized with:

- **Fully async**: All I/O operations are non-blocking for high concurrency
- **Connection pooling**: Reuses connections to upstream servers (100 max, 20 per host)
- **Adaptive buffering**: Dynamic buffer sizing from 1 MB to 16 MB based on upstream speed
- **Pre-buffering**: 4 MB initial buffer before streaming starts
- **Smart timeouts**: 30s connect, 600s read for large streams
- **Retry mechanism**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff on upstream failures
- **Keep-alive**: 65 seconds for connection reuse
- **Streaming response**: Memory-efficient async generators for large streams

## Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  xtreamfilter:
    build: .
    container_name: xtreamfilter
    ports:
      - "8080:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Development

Run locally without Docker:

```bash
cd app
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx jinja2 aiofiles
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload
```
